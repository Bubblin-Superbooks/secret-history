We were received by the gentleman, to whom Clara was directed, with the most cordial friendship. He is an ancient Chevalier de St. Louis, and retains, with much of the formality of the court of France, at which he was raised, all its elegance and urbanity; and having lived a number of years in this island, he is loved and respected by all its inhabitants.</p><p>The letters which father Philip and the governor of Barracoa gave us to their friends, have procured us great attention.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The people here are much the same as at  Barracoa;</p></div> </div>
